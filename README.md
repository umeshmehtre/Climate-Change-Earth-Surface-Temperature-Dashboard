# Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Dashboard uisng Power BI

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for an interactive dashboard visualizing global temperature changes from 1750 to present day. The dashboard was created using Power BI and focuses on analyzing temperature trends across different countries, with a particular emphasis on three major cities.

## Key Features

- Interactive global temperature map
- Time series analysis of temperature changes
- Comparison of temperature trends in major cities
- Latitude and longitude based temperature analysis
- Data preprocessing and cleansing workflows

## Data Sources

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of global surface temperatures, initially containing 7000 entries. This data was preprocessed to focus on key regions and ensure data quality.

## Technologies Used

- Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboard layout
- Python: For data preprocessing and additional analysis

## Key Insights

- Overall rising trend in global temperatures since 1750
- Countries closer to the equator show higher average temperatures
- Significant temperature variations observed across different latitudes and longitudes

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced interactive features (e.g., touchscreen buttons, sliders)
- Enhance accessibility features (e.g., larger font sizes, color schemes for colorblind users)
- Add time markers for easier navigation through the dashboard
